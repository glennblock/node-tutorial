# node.js tutorial slides and code

This repo contains slides and code covering node essentials as well as several of the core modules in node.

Code is inspired by samples on nodejs.org/api. Special thanks to nodejitsu for the keyboard input sample which I used as a reference.

* <b>http_request</b>: using 'http' to create an http request
* <b>file_io_read</b>: using 'fs' to read files
* <b>file_io_write</b>: using 'fs' to write files
* <b>streams</b>: piping data to a stream
* <b>process</b>: using 'process' to access environment variables, arguments, and keyboard input
* <b>child_process</b>: using 'child_process' to execute shell commands and for child processes.
* <b>cluster</b>: using 'cluser' to create worker processes
